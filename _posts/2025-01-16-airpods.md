AirPods are an interesting product because, despite being 10x more expensive than EarPods, the iconic wired version, they are clearly not the better product.

When you're heading out, it's not just your iPhone's battery you need to worry about, but also the batteries in your AirPods and their case. This seems silly given the alternative doesn't even have a battery in the first place. When you run out of juice, which takes just a few hours, it’s game over. You are going to listen to the sounds around you like it’s 1978. EarPods, on the other hand, are passive devices that draw a small amount of power from the iPhone itself. How elegant. I admit the battery issue is a bit theoretical, as charging devices overnight has become one of humanity's strongest habits, but it remains a downside.

Another issue, this one more practical, is the poor voice quality. AirPods simply don't have enough space for decent mics, and they aren’t close enough to your mouth. EarPods come with cable buttons that let you adjust the volume with just a tap – which is faster, more reliable, and less awkward than asking Siri. On the back of the buttons is a microphone, well-positioned near the mouth. Another clear win for the $19 product.

But not being wired to your device is a huge upside – especially when doing sports, chores, or anything that involves moving. Or when you’re watching something while eating and don’t want cable in your spaghetti. The automatic device connection is far from perfect, but it has gotten much smoother over the years. Opening that beautiful case and taking out those little earbuds is already satisfying, but hearing the sound that plays when they connect feels a bit like magic.
