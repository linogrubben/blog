AirPods are an interesting product because, despite being 10x more expensive than EarPods, the iconic wired version, they are not the better product. They are better for certain use cases – but a better product is better overall.

The obvious benefit AirPods have over EarPods is that you’re not wired to your device. This is especially convenient when doing sports, chores, or anything that involves moving. Or when you’re watching something while eating and don’t want cable in your spaghetti. Plus, AirPods don’t have to be plugged in. They connect automatically, which, while far from perfect, has gotten much smoother over the years. Not being wired to your device is a huge upside, but it might be AirPods’ only one – and ironically, it’s also the reason for all of their downsides.

So let’s take a look at them, starting with the batteries. Not only do you have to worry about your iPhone’s battery when leaving the house, but about your AirPods’ battery and their case’s battery too. Quite absurd, considering the alternative doesn’t even have a battery in the first place. When the batteries run out, which takes just a few hours, it’s game over. You are going to listen to the sounds around you like it’s 1978. EarPods, on the other hand, are passive devices that draw a small amount of power from the iPhone itself (less than AirPods since there’s no Bluetooth connection involved). I admit the battery issue is a bit theoretical, as charging devices overnight has become one of humanity’s strongest habits.

Another downside, this one more practical, is the microphones. There simply isn’t enough space for decent mics, and they aren’t close enough to your mouth. EarPods have buttons on the cable that let you adjust the volume with a tap – which is faster, more reliable, and less awkward in public than using Siri. On the back of the buttons is a microphone, well-positioned near the mouth.

But all these downsides don’t seem to matter from a business perspective. By the end of 2025, just 9 years after launch, total sales are expected to exceed 250 million units, putting AirPods in the top 10 of the best-selling tech products of all time. And Apple achieved this at a price point that was unprecedented, once again. There is a popular chart showing that AirPods’ revenue exceeds that of top consumer companies like Spotify, Airbnb, and DoorDash. But the comparison doesn’t make much sense, because AirPods cannot be detached from Apple. All the brand, ecosystem, and distribution Apple has built over decades are what make AirPods successful. There is only one company that can launch this kind of product at such a high price and achieve this level of success.

Today’s AirPods are beautiful and powerful given their size, with really good sound. They are (superficially) convenient, and they make it easy to signal to everyone around you that you’re an advanced Apple user. However, they’re not the better product than the $19 EarPods – and this won’t change anytime soon, because the fundamentals behind it won’t change.
